# Capstone-2021

ST02 Capstone 2021 

These files are for the B4A application and Arduino.
In the B4A file, the executable file is called "Recieve Data from Arduino). The other files are imported external libraries and classes.
The code is fully commented, with suggestions for improvement in the future.
The arduino file contains the exact same file used on our Arduino Uno WIFI Rev 2 configuration in the report. 
We have also included a diagram of how we wired our Arduino for reference. The C.Galipeau thesis section 4 was referred to for certain calculations. 

We do not have a strong background in software, so we understand that there may be some things that could have been done more efficiently. 
Additionally, we do think that moving the framework from the B4A platform to Android Studio is better for future revisions. 
We sincerly hope that this project can become the basis of more advanced future projects and techologies. 

Special thanks to Dr. S. Tullis for his excellent guidance in this Capstone Project.
